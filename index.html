                            <p>"Creativity requires a person understand their relationship to the environment. Learning how to program 
                                is an efficient way for one to repeatedly test validity of thier assumptions. Programming is somewhat unique in this regard
                                because a persom must frequently test the validity of thier assumptions. The ease and economy of programming encourages one to persist 
                                to the point of competancy"</p>

                                    <li>Sudoku Solver and Trainer in Visual Basic (2013). Program solves Sudoku 
                                        puzzles like a person does and can be used to give hints to what the next possible moves are. </li>
                                    <li>Chess Board Program in Visual Basic (2013) which allows only valid moves, 
                                        and can track and store games. This app can be used be people to replay their games 
                                        so they can analyze where they made their mistakes. </li>

                                        and SQL Server 2014. This application allows for multiple pools in multiple sports to simultaneously. The system of eight programs: 
                                        a pool user site, an adminstrator job dipatcher site, a cron job manager, two web scrapping script controllers, 
                                        two web scrapping script(per sport), and a test controller. Six of these scripts transact with SQL Server database through the entity framework.

                                        Django and Rest frameworks, and has a MYSQL database. Application spawns three child processes to maximize cpu useage and minimize simulation time
                                        on server.
